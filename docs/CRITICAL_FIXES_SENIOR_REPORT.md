# 🔧 Critical Fixes Engineering Report
*Senior Engineer Inspection - 2025-09-12*

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** Incorrect price calculation in WorkDrive Batch Processor leading to net prices instead of gross prices in Zoho Bills, despite documents clearly showing gross pricing.

**Impact:** 100% of flower invoices were created with incorrect pricing (net vs gross), causing accounting discrepancies.

**Resolution:** Root cause analysis revealed missing `extracted_text` field in document analysis, preventing proper inclusive/exclusive tax detection.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
**Missing OCR Text in Analysis Object:**
- `analysis.extracted_text` was empty (length: 0)
- Tax inclusion logic couldn't detect "wartość brutto" patterns
- System defaulted to exclusive (net) pricing for all documents

### Secondary Issues
1. **Inconsistent Date Logic:** Bill dates used current date instead of document date
2. **Hardcoded Tax Logic:** Price selection was tied to specific suppliers (HIBISPOL) instead of universal patterns

## 🛠 Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. OCR Text Preservation
**File:** `functions/agent_invoice_parser.py`
**Change:** Added OCR text preservation to analysis object
```python
# BEFORE
data = llm_extract_fields(ocr_text) or {}

# AFTER  
data = llm_extract_fields(ocr_text) or {}
# КРИТИЧЕСКИ ВАЖНО: сохраняем OCR текст в extracted_text для логики inclusive/exclusive
data['extracted_text'] = ocr_text
```

**Impact:** Enables proper tax inclusion detection across all document processors.

### 2. Universal Tax Detection Logic
**File:** `functions/workdrive_batch_processor.py`
**Change:** Replaced supplier-specific logic with universal pattern matching
```python
# BEFORE (Supplier-specific)
hibispol_brutto_pattern = "cena brutto" in doc_text_lower or "cena przed" in doc_text_lower

# AFTER (Universal)
brutto_pattern = "wartość brutto" in doc_text_lower or "cena brutto" in doc_text_lower or "brutto" in doc_text_lower
```

**Impact:** All suppliers now correctly detected for tax inclusion, not just HIBISPOL.

### 3. Accurate Date Handling
**File:** `functions/workdrive_batch_processor.py`
**Change:** Implemented exact date logic from proven handlers.py
```python
# BEFORE (Simplified)
bill_date = sale_date or issue_date or datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# AFTER (Robust with regex fallbacks)
bill_date = None
if analysis.get('issue_date') or analysis.get('document_date') or analysis.get('date'):
    bill_date = self._normalize_date(analysis.get('issue_date') or analysis.get('document_date') or analysis.get('date'))
else:
    txt = analysis.get('extracted_text') or ''
    m = re.search(r"(date of issue|issue date)\s*[:\-]*\s*([A-Za-z]{3,9}\s+\d{1,2},\s*\d{4}|\d{1,2}[./-]\d{1,2}[./-]\d{2,4}|\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})", txt, re.IGNORECASE)
    if m:
        bill_date = self._normalize_date(m.group(2))
```
